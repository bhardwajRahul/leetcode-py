**LeetCode:** [Problem 329](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-path-in-a-matrix/description/)

## Problem Description

Given an `m x n` integers `matrix`, return _the length of the longest increasing path in_ `matrix`.

From each cell, you can either move in four directions: left, right, up, or down. You **may not** move **diagonally** or move **outside the boundary** (i.e., wrap-around is not allowed).

## Examples

### Example 1:

![Example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/05/grid1.jpg)

```
Input: matrix = [[9,9,4],[6,6,8],[2,1,1]]
Output: 4
```

**Explanation:** The longest increasing path is `[1, 2, 6, 9]`.

### Example 2:

![Example 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/27/tmp-grid.jpg)

```
Input: matrix = [[3,4,5],[3,2,6],[2,2,1]]
Output: 4
```

**Explanation:** The longest increasing path is `[3, 4, 5, 6]`. Moving diagonally is not allowed.

### Example 3:

```
Input: matrix = [[1]]
Output: 1
```

## Constraints

- m == matrix.length
- n == matrix[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 200
- 0 <= matrix[i][j] <= 2^31 - 1
